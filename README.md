We search pico libraries that help us doing an efficient job with lighter code.


## Python libs

### Holy Grails and Silver Bullets 🙌

Revelations we had 👼 (Until we meet the killing unresolvable blocking bug 😈):

- Python HTTP Requests for Humans™: [Requests](http://python-requests.org)

### In sight 👀

- Python logging made (stupidly) simple: [Loguru](https://github.com/Delgan/loguru)
- Light-weight utilities to augment, not replace the Python MongoDB driver: [mongo](https://github.com/marrow/mongo)
- A drop-in replacement for native Python datetimes that embraces UTC: [Zulu](https://github.com/dgilland/zulu)
- A package manager for including other people's code in your projects: [Peru](https://github.com/buildinspace/peru)


### Using yet unsatisfying 🤧

We are still using these, though we are **very** open to replace them:

- A Python Object-Document-Mapper for working with MongoDB: [MongoEngine](https://github.com/MongoEngine/mongoengine)


### Rejected 👃

These libs did not meet our requirements in our context, for various reasons:

- A Pythonic, object-oriented interface for working with MongoDB: [Pymodm](https://github.com/mongodb/pymodm)


### Good to know 🧐

- [Python is flawless](https://github.com/satwikkansal/wtfpython)


## CLI tools 🍦

- Command line HTTP client with an intuitive UI: [HTTPie](https://httpie.org/)
- Lightweight and flexible command-line JSON processor: [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/)


## Online tools 🖥

- Open collaboration on text with Markdown: [Hackmd](https://hackmd.io/)
- Secure, fully featured, and completely free video conferencing: [Jit.si](https://meet.jit.si/)
- Build SVG online: [Vectr](https://vectr.com/)
